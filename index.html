									<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
										I am Moussa Azzoug, and I am a student currently at Staffordshire university studying BSc (Hons) Game Development and am an aspiring game developer. I have spent the past three years studying in access creative college where I have learned the basics of games development and even made a small selection of game in the unity, and unreal engines, using tools like blueprints, bolt, and playmaker, to do visual scripting. Overall, my main goal is to be able to make my own games under my own rules but until I have reached that point, I just want to keep learning all different sections of games development. My primary areas of interests are mechanics programming, physics programming, and shaders.

									<h3 style="color: #1d0061;">Skills</h3>
									<ul>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">C++</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have experience making some games using C++ such as my Jump King clone. I have a learned quite a lot about C++ programming and am always ready to learn more.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">C#</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have a lot of experience doing C# programming especially inside of the Unity game engine. I have around two years of C# experience but the amount I know is only growing.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Unreal Blueprints</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have made quite a few projects in unreal engine where I was using blueprints to assist in programming such as my game Hooked, which has helped me a lot in learning how to visual script, and prototype using blueprints in unreal engine.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Unity Playmaker</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have a year worth of experience using play maker in unity where I did manage to make a 2D platformer only with playmaker's state-based coding. This helped me understand FSMs (finite state machines) and how I can use them in the coding processes alongside prototyping.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Blender 3D Modelling</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have a year worth of experience in modeling in blender, and I found myself to get a hand of things quite quickly, although there are many areas left to improve in my 3D modelling skills I have made quite a bit of ground in my year of experience
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Fast Learner</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I am quite an adaptive person when it comes to, in a brief time I pick up quite a bit and even when I do not remember something I just need to repeat the process a few times to get it in my head. All the code I have learned so for in my development processes I did not spend much time, getting to comprehend and nor do there is much that will take me a while to understand.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;" >Time Management</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I cannot claim to have the best time management, but I am always able to organise what tasks need to be done, and by when they should be done, and am able to get the tasks done by when I believe they should be done.

										Pyro is a game jam project ran by my university that I and a group of people all worked on together. The Overall idea was to make a game with destructible terrain, in the case of this game we have wooden tiles that burn when there is fire touching it.
										<br>
										For this game I oversaw the level design as such I was thinking about ways to achieve a fun puzzle aspect with the game, thatâ€™s why I went out of my way to think up mechanics to make the game more interesting. I am the one who decided to have platforms that fall and background object that burns.

										<br><br>
										Hooked was a game I made for my final year in college where I developed a game using unreal engine four and blueprints. The idea behind the game was to create something that would get people to learn a new skill and getting them to socialise as such I made Co-Op multiplayer puzzle game to insight collaboration, and problem solving in those that play. The sole Idea behind Hooked is you have a grappling hook that you use to platform in the game. The game it is self if a local puzzle platformer.
										<br><br>
										Although the main mechanic of the game is the grappling hook I can take no credit for making it as I followed a tutorial for that, but everything else in the game was by my own design. One of my proudest parts was the button in the game where it was able to dynamically change what it's doing depending on the object it's connected to, and if it's connected to the lasers it will turn them off, if it's connected to the platform it'll either flip them up or reset them depending on the configuration of the platform. I also used the material graph to make part of the texture change when the player stands on the button.
										<br><br>
										The second thing I was proud of was the voice lines where they would trigger depending on events going on and how well the player is playing the game, it was my first time making a system like that for dialogue in a game and I was quite happy with it.
										<br><br>
										Every model except the coffee cup and player characters was made by me in blender and although there could be more detail in them I'm happy with what I made overall.
										<br><br>
										The other two things I made was the flipping platform and the lasers which I went out of my way to make them as customisable as possible for the game. What I mean is they are only one asset representing either of them but they have different modes that I can change between in order to change what they can do, for example the lasers can either be on forever or turn off at a button, or the platforms could flip when the player stands on them and revert on their own or wait for the player to press the button. I could even make it so they needed both players on a button in order to activate something.

								</header>

									<video controls width ="50%" height="auto" src="videos/JumpKingDemo.mp4" type="mp4"></video>
									<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
										This is a project I worked on for my first semester in university, the idea was to make a game in C++ using a graphics library developed by the university called S2D. For this project I wanted to create Jump King mainly because I was looking for an excuse to make my own version of Jump King, so I took my chance to try it in this project.
										<br><br>
										For this game, the two big things I did was level building system and a physics system which both took inspiration form an example I found but I did make them into my own. The level building was done from a text file where it would build the contents depending on where characters are placed where in that file, and drawing it to screen required me to know what section of the map was on the screen which I did through a rectangle that represented a camera.
										<br><br>
										For collisions on the level building system, I would check what tiles where next to the player and see if they could go through them or not, and if they could not it would push the player out of the tile. For making sure the right collision was on screen I would have a value representing the current scene that would offset the collision in order to make sure the player is being affected by the right parts.
										<br><br>
										When it comes to physics that was quite simple, the player had a velocity value and the current position would have the velocity added to it every frame, jumping would push the player it the negative of the Y axis and there would be a gravity value trying to pull the player down in the Y. if the player hit a wall while Jumping they would have their velocity reversed in the appropriate axis.
										<br><br>
										There are many more mechanics that I made the game such as, building a full animation system, creating different player states, and more but what I have explained is the parts that stand out the most.
