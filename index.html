									<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
										I'm Moussa Azzoug and I am a student currently at Stafforshire university studing BSc (Hons) Game Development, and am an aspiring game developer. I have spent the the past three years studing in access creative college where I have learned the basics of games development and even made a small selection of game in the unity, and unreal engines, using tools like blueprints, bolt, and playmaker, to do visual scripting. Overall my main goal is to be able to make my own games under my own rules but untill I've reached that point I just want to keep learning all different sections of games development. My main areas of intrests are mechanics programming, physiscs programming, and shaders.

									<h3 style="color: #1d0061;">Skills</h3>
									<ul>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">C++</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have experience making a few games using C++ such as my Jump King clone. I have a learned quite a lot about C++ programming and am always ready to learn more.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">C#</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have a lot of experiance doing C# programming especially inside of the Unity game engine. I have around2 years of C# experiance but the amount I know is only growing.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Unreal Blueprints</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have made quite a few projects in unreal engine where I was using blueprints to assit in programming such as my game Hooked, which has helped me alot in learning how to visual script, and prototype using bluprints in unreal engine.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Unity Playmaker</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have a years worth of experiance using play maker in unity where I did manage to make a 2D platformer only with playmaker's state based codeing. This helped me understand FSMs (finite state machines) and how I can use them in the coding processes along side prototyping.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Blender 3D Modeling</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I have a years worth of experiance in modellin gin blender and I found my self to get a hand of things quite quickly, although there are many areas left to improve in my 3D modeling skills I have made quite a bit of ground in my year of experiance
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;">Fast Learner</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I am quite a fast learner when it comes to, in a short time I pick up quite a bit and even when I don't rememeber something I just need to repate the procces a few times to get it in my head. All the code I have learned so for in my development processes I didn't spend much time getting to comprahend  and nore do I think there is much that will take me a while to understand.
										</p>
										<li style="font-size: 26px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 600;" >Time Managment</li>
										<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
											I can't claim to have the best time management, but I am always able to organise what tasks should be done when and I can get the tasks done by when I belive they should be done.

									<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
										Pyro is an game jam project ran by my university that I and a group of people all worked on together. The Overall idea was to make a game with destructible terrain, in the case of this game we have wooden tiles that burn when there is fire touching it.
										<br>
										For this game I was incharage of the level desing as such I was thinking about ways to achieve a fun puzzle aspect with the game, thats why I went out of my way to think up mechanics to mak the game more intresting. I'm the one who decied to have platforsm that fall and background objects that burn.

									<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
										Hooked was a game I made for my final year in college where I developed a game using unreal engine 4 and blueprints. The idea behind the game was to create something that would be used to get people to learn a new skill whilst getting people to socailise as such I made Co-Op multiplayer puzzle game to insight collabiration, and problem solving in those that play. The sole Idea behind hooked is you have a grappling hook that you use to platform in the game.

								</header>
								<header>
									<p style="font-size: 22px; color: #2f1f55; font-weight: 400;">
										This is a project I worked on for my first semester in University, the idea was to make a game in C++ using a graphics library developed by the university called S2D. For this project I wanted to create Jump King mainly because I was looking for an excuse to make my own version of Jump King, so I took my chance to try it in this project.
